# pollyanna
report the plan as it really is

You may be familiar with the famous and most excellent "Kanned Bannanas",
which draws data from GitHub (using it's GraphQL API) and ZehHub (using it's REST API),
and produces reports of **what actually happened** as well as **what work is currently in progress**.
If not, you should check it out and probably start using it.

Pollyanna is similar, in that it draws data from GitHub GraphQL API and ZenHub REST API,
but different in that it documents **what the plan says is going to happen**.
See, similar but different.

Maybe you need both?
